## The Review
* This particular workshop is a great way to try out these AWS workshops generally.  It basically involves using the UI to create an API gateway + Lambda + Dynamodb table .. nice and easy.  The instructions say to use Cloud9 to test the URL, but I used Cloudshell which is really alot easier, if you don't care about Cloud9.  Also I did not try the clean up steps, because I didn't need to using a training providers account, but it's just some limited UI point-and-click. 

## The Rating
* 9/10

## Suggestions: What I would like to be added/changed
* Optional Step: Create lambda from a docker container -- since we're using the UI, have a provided docker container instead of copy/pasting code would have been useful for many I'd guess
* For all workshops: I would have liked to see CLI equivalent steps, now that there is a cloudshell option.
* Bonus Points: Include a clean up script or CLI commands for the 6 UI clean up steps.
